# Godot Editor Scene Selector

As a programmer you may be used to the editor tabs corresponding to open scripts, but that's not exactly the case with Godot editor, where tabs are reserved for scenes. This can lead to some confusion, and if you experience it, try out this plugin!

**Scene Selector** hides the scene tabs row and adds a couple of controls to the Scene dock instead. You can switch between scenes easily, albeit with a one more click. You can close and run scenes using corresponding buttons. And if you need the old tabs back, there is a button to turn them back on.

Due to plugin API limitations it doesn't handle unsaved, empty scenes well. However, as soon as you save it, it will be properly displayed in the selector. This is something that can likely be fixed in future versions.
